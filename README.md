# Using AWS S3 Buckets in a NodeJS App
Amazon S3 is a cloud computing web service offered by [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), accessible via an API.

The following guide will explain how to set up a simple demo app using the AWS SDK.

First, you'll need to know a few concepts:
- **S3 Bucket**: The basic storage unit for the S3 service. You store different types of objects (data) in these buckets. Buckets and objects can be created, listed, and retrieved using a REST-style HTTP interface or the AWS SDK.
- **Access Key ID**: Allows an application or user to access a set of pre-configured AWS resources, like an S3 Bucket.
- **Secret Access Key**: Is the secret part of the Access Key ID. Think of it as a password for a specific Access Key ID. They must be used always in pairs.

## Step 1: Get your Amazon API keys
The easiest way to obtain an access key pair is to create them for your AWS Console.

In the top-bar, click your user account.

Click in "My security credentials" and "Access keys", finally, click "Create New Access Key".

A modal window should pop-up and it will tell you that your access key pairs have been created. Click in "Show access key" to see both keys, or download them to your computer.

Save the keys in a secure place. You will need them later.

## Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket
On the top-bar, go to "Services". then under the "Storage" heading click "S3" and then click on "Create Bucket".

Then, fill the information required in the form. The bucket name is required and must be unique.

For this example we will leave the properties and permissions with the default values, so click "Next" through all the screens and then "Create bucket".

Your bucket will show up on your Amazon S3 list. Take a note of the bucket name, if you haven't already, as it will be used in your application.

## Step 3: Create a NodeJS project
To start, you will need to create a basic project.

Create a blank project using the following command and entering the required information (project name, repository, license, etc.).

```
npm init
```

Next, create a folder in the root directory with the name "data" and create a text file called `file.txt` and enter some dummy content.

In Terminal, go to the root folder of your app and using the following command, install the [AWS SDK module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk) for JavaScript.

```
npm install aws-sdk --save
```

Since we will be using environment variables, rather than hard-coding key-pairs and bucket names into our app, we also need to install the [dotenv module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), using the following command:

```
npm install dotenv --save
```

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config) methodology.

We also need a start file for the application. In the root directory, create a file called `start.js`. The file can be empty for now.

Now, to create the file that we will use to upload a file to the S3 bucket. In the root directory, create a file called `index.js` with the following content:

```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

dotenv.config();

// configure the AWS environment
AWS.config.update({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
});

let s3 = new AWS.S3();
let filePath = "./data/file.txt";

// configure parameters
let params = {
  Bucket: process.env.AWS_BUCKET,
  Body: fs.createReadStream(filePath),
  Key: "folder/" + Date.now() + "_" + path.basename(filePath)
};

// upload to S3
s3.upload(params, (err, data) => {
  //handle error
  if (err) {
    console.log("Error:", err);
  }

  //success
  if (data) {
    console.log("Uploaded to:", data.Location);
  }
});
```

Next, create a file named `.env` with the following content. Add your `access key ID`, `secret access key` and `bucket name` you rcreated earlier.
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_BUCKET=
```

Once everything is saved, you're good to start. In Terminal, type the following command:
```
npm start
```

Next, in Terminal type the following command:
```
node index.js
```

If successful, you should see a message in the console stating the file has been uploaded and where it has been uploaded to. If you go to the [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home) you should be able to see your file listed.
